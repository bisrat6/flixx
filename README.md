 Movie Info Platform

A lightweight movie information platform built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS.
Users can search for movies and view detailed information such as posters, overviews, release dates, and ratings
â€” all powered by a movie API like [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
